                  <br />
                  XFIT gave us corporate discounts on equipment, developed a design project, and
                  gave us many recommendations.<br />
                  I am very involved in fitness, so I myself took an active part in the development
                  of the concept, ideas, features, and the choice of fitness equipment for the
                  studio.<br />
                  It turned out to be a cool symbiosis: on our side - involvement, fresh ideas and a
                  great desire to create a worthy fitness project, on the part of XFIT - experience,
                  knowledge, expertise and support.

                  Choosing a business partner is the most crucial step.<br />
                  Our team did a lot of work before making a final decision.<br />
                  Speaking from experience, we were very lucky.<br />
                  Today XFIT is the best team of fitness professionals in Russia and, perhaps, in
                  the entire CIS.<br />
                  Unlike its competitors, XFIT has not lost its ambition during the crisis and is
                  constantly evolving.<br />
                  It is worth noting that I myself was pleasantly surprised by the degree of
                  automation of business models.

                <h5>
                  <br />
                  We decided to launch our own fitness project, since we owned a suitable vacant
                  space in the ice hockey arena.<br />
                  What attracted us to the XFIT franchise was the relatively low price (we compared
                  it with other major operators), as well as the growing brand with good prospects
                  for consolidation in the business and premium segments.<br />
                  Consulting with XFIT helped us plan and build a fitness center wisely.<br />
                  We reached 100% of the planned occupancy of the club in 6 months after opening,
                  and the price of the card, which was assumed in a 5-year model, was set after 9
                  months.<br />
                  The success is also due to large investments in the equipment of the club, as well
                  as the professional work of the management team.<br />
                  With the right location and precise organization, business thrives!<br />

                  When we bought the franchise, we immediately felt the partner’s support at all
                  stages and that we were needed.<br />
                  The franchiser showed the utmost interest in our launch, and, what was especially
                  important to us, the partner constantly guided us from the selection of premises
                  to the opening of the club, while promptly responding to our queries.<br />
                  The franchise gave us such essential things as a recognizable brand, a unique club
                  format, quality staff training and access to equipment leaders.

                  We already have three full-size fitness clubs operating under the XFIT brand in
                  the cities of Kineshma, Ivanovo and Kostroma.<br />
                  We are satisfied with the way the business is working. XFIT has handed us an
                  effective financial model for the fitness club, provided us with special
                  conditions for using the franchise and is providing support.

                  What attracted us to the XFIT franchise was the price, the conditions and, of
                  course, the well-known brand.<br />
                  We already had a negative experience of working with another franchise, so we have
                  something to compare it with.<br />
                  We like working with XFIT: the support, the advertising campaigns, and the low
                  royalty rate.

              Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by

              <br />
              This Privacy Policy applies to our website, and its associated subdomains

              our Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to our collection,
              storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy

              What Information Do We Collect?<br />
              We collect information from you when you visit our website, register on our site,
              place an order, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey or fill out a
              form.<br />

              <br />
              When does XFIT use end user information from third parties?<br />
              XFIT will collect End User Data necessary to provide the XFIT services to our
              customers. End users may voluntarily provide us with information they have made
              available on social media websites. If you provide us with any such information, we
              may collect publicly available information from the social media websites you have
              indicated. You can control how much of your information social media websites make
              public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.<br /><br />
              <br />
              When does XFIT use customer information from third parties?<br />
              We receive some information from the third parties when you contact us. For example,
              when you submit your email address to us to show interest in becoming a XFIT customer,
              we receive information from a third party that provides automated fraud detection
              services to XFIT. We also occasionally collect information that is made publicly
              available on social media websites. You can control how much of your information
              social media websites make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy
              settings.<br />
              <br />
              Do we share the information we collect with third parties?<br />
              We may share the information that we collect, both personal and non-personal, with
              third parties such as advertisers, contest sponsors, promotional and marketing
              partners, and others who provide our content or whose products or services we think
              may interest you. We may also share it with our current and future affiliated
              companies and business partners, and if we are involved in a merger, asset sale or
              other business reorganization, we may also share or transfer your personal and
              non-personal information to our successors-in-interest.<br />
              <br />
              We may engage trusted third party service providers to perform functions and provide
              services to us, such as hosting and maintaining our servers and the website, database
              storage and management, e-mail management, storage marketing, credit card processing,
              customer service and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase
              through the website. We will likely share your personal information, and possibly some
              non-personal information, with these third parties to enable them to perform these
              services for us and for you.<br />
              <br />
              We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics
              purposes with third parties such as web analytics partners, application developers,
              and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general
              location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited
              the website in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit the website.
              They may aggregate information about our advertising and what you see on the website
              and then provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers.<br />
              <br />
              We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or
              law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe
              necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including
              subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety
              of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally
              actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules
              and regulations.<br />
              <br />
              Where and when is information collected from customers and end users?<br />
              XFIT will collect personal information that you submit to us. We may also receive
              personal information about you from third parties as described above.<br />
              <br />
              How Do We Use The Information We Collect?<br />
              Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following
              ways:<br />
              * To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your
              individual needs)<br />
              * To improve our website (we continually strive to improve our website offerings based
              on the information and feedback we receive from you)<br />
              * To improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond
              to your customer service requests and support needs)<br />
              * To process transactions<br />
              * To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature<br />
              * To send periodic emails<br />
              <br />
              How Do We Use Your Email Address?<br />
              By submitting your email address on this website, you agree to receive emails from us.
              You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking
              on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective
              email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either
              directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails,
              because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also
              agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites
              like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have
              opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the
              order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and
              updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us
              through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy.
              Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we
              include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.<br />
              <br />
              How Long Do We Keep Your Information?<br />
              We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide XFIT to you and fulfill
              the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share
              your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer
              need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our
              legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or
              depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.<br />
              <br />
              How Do We Protect Your Information?<br />
              We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal
              information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal
              information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit
              information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted
              into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized
              with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information
              confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social
              security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure
              or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to XFIT or guarantee
              that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or
              destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<br />
              <br />
              Could my information be transferred to other countries?<br />
              XFIT is incorporated in Hong Kong. Information collected via our website, through
              direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from
              time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the
              world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that
              may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such
              data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you
              voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.<br />
              <br />
              Is the information collected through the XFIT Service secure?<br />
              We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical,
              electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access,
              maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people
              nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people
              can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore,
              while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot
              guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty
              to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be
              the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.<br />
              <br />
              Can I update or correct my information?<br />
              The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information XFIT collects
              depend on your relationship with XFIT. Personnel may update or correct their
              information as detailed in our internal company employment policies.<br />
              <br />
              Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of
              personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1)
              update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your
              preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us,
              or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our
              systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such
              updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information
              that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance
              with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To
              protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a
              unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making
              corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password
              and account information at all times.<br />
              <br />
              You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every
              record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up
              our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your
              information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for
              us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored
              in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated,
              corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably
              and technically practicable.<br />
              <br />
              If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have
              about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a
              customer.<br />
              <br />
              Personnel<br />
              If you are a XFIT worker or applicant, we collect information you voluntarily provide
              to us. We use the information collected for Human Resources purposes in order to
              administer benefits to workers and screen applicants.<br />
              <br />
              You may contact us in order to (1) update or correct your information, (2) change your
              preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us,
              or (3) receive a record of the information we have relating to you. Such updates,
              corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we
              maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with
              this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.<br />
              <br />
              Sale of Business<br />
              We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale,
              merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of XFIT or any of
              its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that portion of XFIT or any of its
              Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we discontinue
              our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy,
              reorganization or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere
              to the terms of this Privacy Policy.<br />
              <br />
              Affiliates<br />
              We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our
              Corporate Affiliates. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Corporate Affiliate" means
              any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is
              under common control with XFIT, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information
              relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those
              Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.<br />
              <br />
              Governing Law<br />
              This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of Hong Kong without regard to its
              conflict of laws provision. You consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in
              connection with any action or dispute arising between the parties under or in
              connection with this Privacy Policy except for those individuals who may have rights
              to make claims under Privacy Shield, or the Swiss-US framework.<br />
              <br />
              The laws of United Arab Emirates, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern
              this Agreement and your use of the website. Your use of the website may also be
              subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.<br />
              <br />
              By using XFIT or contacting us directly, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy
              Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you should not engage with our
              website, or use our services. Continued use of the website, direct engagement with us,
              or following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy that do not significantly
              affect the use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you accept
              those changes.<br />
              <br />
              Your Consent<br />
              We've updated our Privacy Policy to provide you with complete transparency into what
              is being set when you visit our site and how it's being used. By using our XFIT,
              registering an account, or making a purchase, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy
              and agree to its terms.<br />
              <br />
              Links to Other Websites<br />
              This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to
              other websites not operated or controlled by XFIT. We are not responsible for the
              content, accuracy or opinions expressed in such websites, and such websites are not
              investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by us. Please remember
              that when you use a link to go from the Services to another website, our Privacy
              Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website,
              including those that have a link on our platform, is subject to that website’s own
              rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own cookies or other methods to
              collect information about you.<br />
              <br />

              XFIT uses "Cookies" to identify the areas of our website that you have visited. A
              Cookie is a small piece of data stored on your computer or mobile device by your web
              browser. We use Cookies to enhance the performance and functionality of our website
              but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain

              your login details every time you visit the website as we would not be able to

              already visited your website. It allows your company to seem like they're “following”
              people around the internet by serving ads on the websites and platforms they use

              Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)<br />
              We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European
              Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain
              exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under
              protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.<br />

              What is GDPR?<br />
              GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents'
              data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over
              their personal data.<br />
              <br />
              The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based
              businesses and EU residents. Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where
              they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline
              standard for all our operations worldwide.<br />
              <br />
              What is personal data?<br />
              Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad
              spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other
              pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s
              name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political
              opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual
              orientation, and ethnicity.<br />
              <br />
              The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:<br />
              <br />
              * Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and
              should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.<br />
              * Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should
              only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal
              data when they collect it.<br />
              * Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.<br />
              * People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They
              can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted,
              restricted, or moved to another organization.<br />
              <br />
              Why is GDPR important?<br />
              GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals'
              personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance
              by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts
              it's simply the right thing to do. At XFIT we strongly believe that your data privacy
              is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place
              that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.<br />
              <br />
              Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion<br />
              We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of
              GDPR. XFIT processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant
              vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your
              account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms
              of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.<br />
              <br />
              We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide
              them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got
              you! We've been set up as self service from the start and have always given you access
              to your data and your customers data. Our customer support team is here for you to
              answer any questions you might have about working with the API.<br />

              California Residents<br />
              The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to disclose categories of
              Personal Information we collect and how we use it, the categories of sources from whom
              we collect Personal Information, and the third parties with whom we share it, which we

              categories of sources from which we collect Personal Information; and (4) specific
              pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.<br />

              privacy rights.<br />
              * Right to Delete. You may submit a verifiable request to close your account and we
              will delete Personal Information about you that we have collected.<br />
              * Request that a business that sells a consumer's personal data, not sell the
              consumer's personal data.<br />
              <br />
              If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to
              exercise any of these rights, please contact us.<br />
